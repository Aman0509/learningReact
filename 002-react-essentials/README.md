## It's all about Components! [Core Concept]

A React component is a modular, reusable piece of code responsible for rendering a part of a user interface. It encapsulates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic, representing specific sections or elements within an application's UI. Components can be composed, combined, and reused to build complex user interfaces. They can manage their own state, receive data via props, and are the fundamental building blocks used in React applications to structure and render UI elements.

**Core Concept: Components**

- React revolves around Components, the reusable building blocks for UI construction.
- They're combined to form the entire user interface in React applications.

**Essential Role of Components**

- Every React app, regardless of complexity, relies on Components as its foundation.
- They encapsulate HTML, CSS, and related JavaScript logic, controlling specific UI sections.

**Universal Concept Beyond React**

- Building UIs from Components isn't exclusive to React; it's a widespread concept across websites and applications.

**Identifiable Components in Websites**

- Websites showcase key building blocks such as headers, tabs, etc., each serving as Components.

**Granularity and Flexibility**

- Component size and scope are determined by developers, facilitating reusability across the UI.

**Benefits of the Component Approach**

- Prevents unwieldy HTML files, aids in code navigation, and minimizes complexity.
- Enables code reusability, reducing errors by allowing changes in one location.
- Organizes related code cohesively, unlike scattered markup and JavaScript files.

**Separation of Concerns**

- Components follow the principle of handling distinct UI functionalities, fostering clarity and ease of development.

**Widespread Adoption**

- The Components concept extends beyond React, found in various front-end frameworks and even in mobile development frameworks like Flutter.

## JSX & React Components [Core Concept]

JSX, standing for JavaScript Syntax Extension, is a powerful feature in React that enables developers to describe and create HTML elements within JavaScript files. This capability is instrumental in React, where the focus lies on building user interfaces and their components.

Despite being extensively used in React and adopted in various non-React projects, JSX isn't supported by browsers directly. For instance, the code written in files like index.jsx and App.jsx wouldn't function as is in browsers. Instead, React code, including JSX, undergoes transformation before reaching the browser. The development server compiles it into browser-compatible code behind the scenes.

The key takeaway from JSX is its ability to provide a more convenient and intuitive way of defining user interfaces. In React, a crucial part of the code, like the App.jsx file, represents a React Component. Components, as emphasized in prior lectures, are essentially JavaScript functions. However, for React to recognize and utilize these functions as Components, they must adhere to specific rules:

**Naming Convention:**

- The function name must start with an uppercase character.

**Return Value:**

- The function must return a renderable value, typically comprising JSX code representing the HTML markup to be rendered.
