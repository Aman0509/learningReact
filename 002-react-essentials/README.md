## It's all about Components! [Core Concept]

A React component is a modular, reusable piece of code responsible for rendering a part of a user interface. It encapsulates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic, representing specific sections or elements within an application's UI. Components can be composed, combined, and reused to build complex user interfaces. They can manage their own state, receive data via props, and are the fundamental building blocks used in React applications to structure and render UI elements.

**Core Concept: Components**

- React revolves around Components, the reusable building blocks for UI construction.
- They're combined to form the entire user interface in React applications.

**Essential Role of Components**

- Every React app, regardless of complexity, relies on Components as its foundation.
- They encapsulate HTML, CSS, and related JavaScript logic, controlling specific UI sections.

**Universal Concept Beyond React**

- Building UIs from Components isn't exclusive to React; it's a widespread concept across websites and applications.

**Identifiable Components in Websites**

- Websites showcase key building blocks such as headers, tabs, etc., each serving as Components.

**Granularity and Flexibility**

- Component size and scope are determined by developers, facilitating reusability across the UI.

**Benefits of the Component Approach**

- Prevents unwieldy HTML files, aids in code navigation, and minimizes complexity.
- Enables code reusability, reducing errors by allowing changes in one location.
- Organizes related code cohesively, unlike scattered markup and JavaScript files.

**Separation of Concerns**

- Components follow the principle of handling distinct UI functionalities, fostering clarity and ease of development.

**Widespread Adoption**

- The Components concept extends beyond React, found in various front-end frameworks and even in mobile development frameworks like Flutter.
