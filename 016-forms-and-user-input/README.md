Forms are crucial in web development but can be challenging due to two main tasks: handling submission and validating user input. A form consists of input fields and labels wrapped by the HTML form element. Handling submission and extracting user data can be done via state management, refs, or browser features like the form data object.

The tricky part is validation, aiming to provide a good user experience. Validation can occur on every keystroke, when an input field loses focus, or upon form submission. Each approach has drawbacks, such as showing errors too early, too late, or for too long. This course section will explore these approaches and their combinations to help you choose and implement the best validation strategy for your app and users.
