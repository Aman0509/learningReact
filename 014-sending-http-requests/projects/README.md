## Starting Project

This project (React frontend + Node.js backend) is a web application called "Placepicker" that enables users to select and deselect places. Unlike before, data is fetched from and stored on the backend, not the frontend. You'll focus on the React application that interacts with this dummy backend, not backend development itself.
