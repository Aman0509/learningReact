## What is React.js? And why would you use it?

***React.js, commonly known as React, is an open-source JavaScript library primarily used for building user interfaces (UI) and handling the view layer for web and mobile applications. Developed by Facebook, React allows developers to create interactive, reusable UI components. Its key feature is the ability to efficiently update and render components when the underlying data changes, thanks to its virtual DOM (Document Object Model) implementation. React follows a declarative and component-based approach, enabling developers to create complex UIs by composing small, isolated components. This library is widely favored for its performance optimizations, maintainability, and its capability to create dynamic, fast, and responsive user interfaces.***

When you explore the official webpage, [react.dev](https://react.dev/), the essence becomes clear. React serves as a library designed for crafting user interfaces, both for web and native platforms. In simpler terms, it streamlines the creation of user interfaces.

It's primarily a JavaScript library tailored for this purpose, emphasizing the seamless development of interfaces. However, this explanation leaves another question unanswered: why opt for React? The answer unravels when you visit a React-powered webpage like Netflix.

When navigating such sites, the transitions are incredibly smooth, almost instantaneous, devoid of the usual delay associated with loading new pages. This creates an experience akin to using a mobile app, where immediate responses and fluid transitions are the norm. React and similar libraries facilitate the construction of such user experiences for the web.

How does React achieve this? By leveraging JavaScript within the browser, it dynamically updates the visible interface without requiring a page reload. JavaScript's ability to manipulate a webpage after it loads is key. For instance, when clicking the movies tab, JavaScript can discreetly fetch movie data in the background, seamlessly updating the screen with this data, thus ensuring smooth transitions between pages.

Now, you might wonder why we need React when JavaScript appears capable on its own. While using pure JavaScript is an option, it's laborious, error-prone, and especially challenging for complex user interfaces and applications like the Netflix web app. Without a library like React, relying solely on vanilla JavaScript becomes impractical and immensely burdensome.

- Writing complex JavaScript code quickly becomes cumbersome.
- Complex JavaScript code quickly becomes error-prone.
- Complex JavaScript code often is hard to maintain or edit.
- React offers a simpler mental model.
